Timeline: 

Friday EOD: Repo set up, JS/CSS/HTML files linked, display a title, etc. in the browser to test README file mostly done (need deployment link, final screenshots)

Weekend: Scaffold sections in the app, work on getting as MUCH done as possible over the weekend! The farther you get over the weekend, the better next week will go for you!

Monday AM: You should have the basics for your app set up. You should have cached element references defined, event listeners configured and tested (console.log!!!), and basic control flow implemented.

Monday EOD: Your control flow sections of code should all be organized properly and you should have at least started the basics of coding out the appâ€™s functionality

Tuesday EOD: Your app should be mostly working, a few bugs left to fix.

Wednesday EOD: Your app should be 90-100% functional, with just styling left.

Thursday EOD: Your app is beautiful because you spent the whole day styling it.

Friday: Profit.
